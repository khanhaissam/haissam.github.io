## 🧠 About Me

I'm a project manager with 14+ years of experience in engineering, digital transformation, and operations — currently leading continuous improvement and safety innovation projects at **Air Liquide Japan**.

Alongside my day job, I design and prototype practical AI tools that solve everyday industrial and project challenges — from heat safety alerts to Lean toolkits and weather-based construction planning.

I'm not a software engineer by training — but I love observing inefficiencies, rethinking systems, and building useful solutions (with no-code or low-code if needed!).

## 🚀 My AI Tooling Projects

Here are a few web apps I've recently built — all public, open-source, and bilingual (🇬🇧 / 🇯🇵):

| Project | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|
| [🌡️ Heatstroke Risk Checker](https://khanhaissam.github.io/heatstroke-risk-checker/) | Checks WBGT and weather to assess heatstroke risk for workers (compliant with MHLW & JIS) |
| [🏗️ Concrete Pour Window](https://khanhaissam.github.io/concrete-pour-weather-window/) | Flags safe/unsafe weather windows for concrete placement (based on ACI thresholds) |
| [🍱 AI Restaurant Finder](https://khanhaissam.github.io/live-restaurant-finder/) | Finds halal/vegetarian options in Japan with AI-summarized reviews |
| [🧪 Periodic Table of Process Tools](https://khanhaissam.github.io/process-tools-periodic-table/) | Helps teams explore 100+ Lean/Six Sigma tools, with AI action plans |
| [🤖 Agent Prompt Register (Coming Soon)](#) | Interactive dashboard to learn and design AI agents based on Google’s whitepaper |

> All tools are built to demonstrate real-world AI use in project workflows, safety planning, and knowledge enablement.
